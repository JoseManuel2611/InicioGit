# 7 y 1/2 Solitaire

- The game is played with a standard deck of cards.
- Each card has a value: numbered cards (2-7) are worth their face value, face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 0.5, and Aces are worth 1.
- The player draws cards from the deck and adds their values to their total score.
- The player can choose to stop drawing cards at any time.
